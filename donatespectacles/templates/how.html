<p class="lead"> About us </p>

  Our organization, we aim at creating a self sustainable model for recycling old spectacles and making it

reach the needy. This model is not possible without the donor, the receiver, and an optician. Hence, we are trying to

reach out to as many people who fall in the three categories to make this non-profit motive project a success.

 For the benefit of our valuable donors, opticians, NGO’s (who will help us reach the end users), we will provide a 

common IT platform which can be accessible by all our stakeholders to check the requirement list, current status of

the spectacle inventory available with us and also provide the donor an option to track the status of his/her donated 

spectacle.

To kick start with the collection of old spectacles, we are looking at corporate offices and similar institutions to get the 

required numbers whose power will be monitored by our opticians and promptly be updated on the website, ready to 

be picked by the NGO’s. 

Apart from a great sense of satisfaction, we shall express our gratitude to the donor by offering a discount voucher 

from one amongst the leading eyewear retail outlets on their next purchase of the spectacle from the store.

So, lets join our hands together to make the other person’s life brighter as easily by making the little effort of donating 

your old spectacles that are lying unattended at the shelf!
