We provide these ngo's with a list of available spectacles and deliver to them based on their requirements. We are looking to add more such NGO's to the list so that we can be more effective. If you are an NGO and would have need for spectacles, then please get in touch with us and we would make an arrangement to add you on our list of Partner NGO's.
